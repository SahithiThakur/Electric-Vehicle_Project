# Electric-Vehicle_Project
## 🚗 Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of electric vehicles (EVs) using a dataset that encompasses various aspects of EV trends, registrations, and preferences. The aim is to uncover key insights that can enhance understanding of the EV market and its growth trajectory.

## 📊 Objectives

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends and relationships within the dataset.
- Visualize the distribution of EV vehicles using a **Choropleth map** to display regional adoption rates.
- Create a **Racing Bar Plot** to animate the count of EV makes over the years, showcasing shifts in market popularity.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly Express**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **Matplotlib**: For additional plotting needs.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about electric vehicle registrations, including variables such as:

- VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)
- Model Year
- State
- City

The dataset is essential for conducting both univariate and bivariate analyses.

## 📈 Key Findings

- Identified significant trends in EV registrations over the years.
- Highlighted top cities and states with high EV adoption rates.
- Revealed insights into consumer preferences regarding different EV makes and models.

## 📌 Visualizations

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted univariate and bivariate analyses to explore the dataset.

### 2. Choropleth Map
Created a choropleth map using Plotly Express to visualize the number of EV vehicles based on location.

### 3. Racing Bar Plot
Developed a racing bar plot to display the animation of EV makes and their counts each year.

## 📝 Conclusion
These insights can serve as a foundation for stakeholders in the automotive industry, policymakers, and researchers to make informed decisions regarding electric vehicle strategies, infrastructure development, and sustainability initiatives.

As the demand for electric vehicles continues to grow, ongoing analysis and monitoring will be crucial to understanding this transformative sector and its impact on the environment and the economy. This project highlights the importance of data-driven approaches in navigating the future of transportation.
